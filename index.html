    <p> Vector artwork is a term that describes any art made with vector illustration software. <br>
        Vector artwork is built from vector graphics, which are images created with mathematical equations. <br>
        These mathematical equations are translated into points that are connected by either lines or curves, <br>
        also known as vector paths, and they make up all the different shapes you see in a vector graphic. <br>
   <br>
        Vector graphics have the unique advantage over raster graphics in that the points, lines, and curves <br>
        may be scaled up or down to any resolution with no aliasing. This resolution independence allows 
         <br> 
        vector art to be used in a variety of forms, from small illustrations to massive billboards.

<p> Vector graphics are commonly found today in the SVG, EPS, PDF or AI types of graphic file formats, 
<br> and are intrinsically different from the more common raster graphics file formats such as JPEG, PNG, <br>
APNG, GIF, and MPEG4.

</p>

<h2> Standards </h2>

<p> <strong> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </strong> standard for vector graphics is <strong> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) </strong>. 
<br>The standard is complex and has been relatively slow to be established at least in part owing to commercial interests. 
<br>Many web browsers now have some support for rendering SVG data but full implementations of the standard are still 
<br> comparatively rare. In recent years, SVG has become a significant format that is completely independent of the resolution 
<br> of the rendering device, typically a printer or display monitor. SVG files are essentially printable text that describes 
<br>both straight and curved paths, as well as other attributes. Wikipedia prefers SVG for images such as simple maps, line 
<br>illustrations, coats of arms, and flags, which generally are not like photographs or other continuous-tone images. Rendering 
<br>SVG requires conversion to raster format at a resolution appropriate for the current task. SVG is also a format for animated 
<br>graphics. There is also a version of SVG for mobile phones. In particular, the specific format for mobile phones is called 
<br><strong>SVGT (SVG Tiny version)</strong>. These images can count links and also exploit anti-aliasing. They can also be <br>
displayed as wallpaper.
